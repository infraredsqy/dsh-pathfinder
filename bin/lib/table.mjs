The table is the built-in settings plus every knob the installed plugins declare -- `list` prints it, and a name nobody declares is refused. Not every knob takes every layer: a core setting takes the project and global layers, a plugin's knob takes all four (`set` names the layers a knob takes when it refuses one). The line's own policies -- `parallel`, `when_shelved`, `spawner` -- are not settings and are not here: they live on the line record, written by `pf cycle policy`. The two file layers are `~/.pf/config.json` (global: travels with the person and the machine, never generated for you) and `<project>/.pf/config.json` (travels with the project; `init` puts an empty `{}` there); the two narrow ones ride on the cycle record and on one node's own `config.json`. `set` stores a value and `unset` drops that one layer's entry -- a switch is turned off by setting `off`, while dropping its entry is `unset` (the same split `pf cycle policy` explains). `set` / `unset` write exactly one layer: the project layer unless --global / --cycle / --node says otherwise.",
