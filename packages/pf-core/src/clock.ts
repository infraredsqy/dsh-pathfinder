 * come from the wall clock (`Date.now()`), the microsecond tail from the monotonic
 * clock (`process.hrtime.bigint()`) — the wall clock is only millisecond-coarse, the
 * monotonic clock fills the elapsed time between two readings down to microseconds,
 * so the microsecond digits are real and no longer always zero. Strictly increasing
 * within the process — writes in the same microsecond each get their own timestamp,
 * none shares a value with another.
 *
 * Lines (state.json), handoff tickets, instructions and session files use the seconds
 * shape (`2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`): the wall clock truncated to seconds, writes in the
 * same second share one reading — the seconds shape is coarse by design.
