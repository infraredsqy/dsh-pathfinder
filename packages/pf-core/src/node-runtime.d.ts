/**
 * Self-contained type declarations for the Node built-in surface.
 *
 * This package pulls in no third-party type package: devDependencies may only be
 * typescript / tsdown / vitest (a hard boundary the guard test pins),
 * and tsc only scans src/, so every node built-in surface src uses is declared here as a
 * minimal subset. The shapes follow the corresponding signatures of Node's official
 * @types/node, never more; to use a new built-in surface, declare it here first — no
 * package pulled in, no devDeps changed.
 *
 * This is the companion move under the "zero runtime dependencies" boundary: the runtime
 * carries these built-ins anyway, this only reports the small block of names src/ uses so
 * that tsc recognises them.
