/**
 * Settings: reading and writing along one resolution chain — the same set of knobs is written on the
 * narrower layer and resolved by the chain into the value in use.
 *
 * The layers of the chain, narrowest first; narrow overrides wide, whoever states it first wins:
 *
 *     node      `<root>/.pf/nodes/<id>/config.json`   one node's own round
 *     cycle     the `policies` slot of the line record one work line
 *     project   `<root>/.pf/config.json`             travels with the project (init lays down an empty object)
 *     global    `<home>/.pf/config.json`             travels with this machine (nobody generates it for you)
 *     builtin   the `default` of the knob list       where it lands when nobody said anything
 *
 * How the four verbs divide the work:
 *
 * - `set` / `unset` land on exactly one layer, and that layer is **named** by the caller — there is no
 *   default layer, because a hidden default is the easiest way to change a setting in the wrong place.
 *   The four spellings are `{ project: true }`, `{ global: true }`, `{ cycle: '<line id>' }` and
 *   `{ node: '<node id>' }`; naming none, or naming two, is refused on the spot. A line id or a node id
 *   that does not exist is refused as well (nothing is created for the caller), and so is a layer the
 *   knob does not accept — that refusal names the layers it does accept.
 * - `get` reads one setting and hands back `{ value, source }`; `list` reads every setting and hands
 *   back the same pair per key. Both read the chain from the widest layer inward and stop at the layer
 *   the caller named (`at`), the two wide layers when nothing was named; `source` says which layer the
 *   value in force came from, and `builtin` says nobody on the chain stated anything (the declaration's
 *   default is in force — see the defaults rule below). The line layer sits between the project layer
 *   and a node's own: a `{ node }` read is placed on the one line holding that node — no holder means
 *   the node has no line-layer value and the line layer is skipped, and a record putting one node in
 *   two lines' hands is refused by name instead of guessed past. A `{ node }` read resolves its id the
 *   way a write does: an id that is not on the graph is refused `node_not_found`, while a node on the
 *   graph with no settings file of its own is no error — that layer states nothing and the reading goes
 *   on below it.
 * - Every verb takes an optional directory to work in. Left out, the handle's own project root is
 *   used; either way that directory has to hold a `.pf` of its own — a directory that is not a pf
 *   project root is refused outright, never guessed upward to a wider directory. A fork-mode node works
 *   in a worktree of its own; under the own-repo layout that checkout carries no `.pf`, so the agent there
 *   is told the directory is not a pf project instead of being handed the main tree's settings (under the
 *   in-repo layout the records travel with the checkout, so the verb answers from that worktree's own
 *   records). A relative path is resolved against the process's current directory.
 *
 * There are only four kinds: `number` (a positive numeric value), `integer` (a positive integer), `word` (a
 * word from a vocabulary), `switch` (on / off). The read side and the write side go through the same
 * `parseConfigValue` — a JSON value read from disk and a string handed in from the command line pass the
 * same gate, so the boundary of a kind is written once. The write side has two extra rules: number /
 * integer take positive values only (0 would put every reading over the bound); `off` is a value for a
 * switch; for a non-switch kind, writing `off` is refused just like writing any other word outside the
 * vocabulary — taking a layer off is the job of `unset`.
 *
 * Which layers each knob accepts is stated in its own cell: a built-in setting governs the whole project
 * or the whole machine, so it takes only the project / global layers (the override switch is even
 * narrower and takes the global layer alone); a knob a plugin declares is read by the host along the
 * whole chain, taking all four layers by default, and a declaration that narrows it is followed.
 * `set` / `unset` refuse a layer the knob does not take, naming the layers it does take, and `get`
 * refuses the same way; `list` has no key to refuse, so it shows the chain up to the named layer — a
 * knob that does not take that layer is shown from the layer below it. The three line-level policy keys
 * (parallel / when_shelved / spawner) live on the line record and are written by
 * `ledger.cycles.setPolicy`; this module does not know them.
 *
 * Defaults: every setting the engine declares carries one — a literal, or a function of the project root
 * when the answer is worked out per project (the worktree mode follows whether the project has a `.git`).
 * A core declaration that carries none, or carries a `null`, is refused the moment the list is merged,
 * naming the setting, so no core reading runs into "not configured": the factory value is always there
 * and its source is `builtin`. A plugin declaration is not put through that gate, but its cells state a
 * default too: there `null` is the spelling for "no factory value", its way of saying "this line was never
 * set up", and `null` stays a reading (the plugin knob reader keeps that meaning); a cell that leaves the
 * key out is turned away where the declaration is read. A declared default that is not of its own
 * kind is a broken cell: the cell does not enter the list, the knob then reads as unknown, and — because a
 * broken cell is a declaration problem — the whole plugin it belongs to takes no part (its close-time work
 * is skipped) until the cell is fixed; doctor names the plugin and the knob. A malformed declaration never
 * stops a settings verb or a dispatch: the read side keeps answering for every knob that can be honoured.
 *
 * Only two kinds of thing stop a reading: the caller's pointer — a layer the knob does not accept, or
 * a line / node id that is not on the record — and a layer file that cannot be read or parsed.
 * Everything else about the files is silent, because none of it changes a reading: an unknown name (a
 * plugin was removed, a key was renamed), a known name sitting in a layer that does not take it, and a
 * value that is not of its kind are all skipped — the value that counts is the next layer's, or the
 * declaration's default. The write side is where those mistakes are caught: `set` refuses the wrong
 * layer, the unknown name and the value of the wrong kind, so a file carrying one of them was edited by
 * hand and the person who edited it knows which layer it went into.
 *
 * Writing the line layer: the `policies` slot of `state.json` is written from this one place
 * (`ledger.cycles.setPolicy` goes through the same slot), read and rewritten as a whole document, holding
 * the record tree's lock throughout, past the init gate first.
