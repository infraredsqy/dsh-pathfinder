/**
 * The six runtime environment switches, in the one place that reads them.
 *
 * A switch is read **on every call**, never cached at import time: a sandbox that moves the
 * machine layer or the plugin folder between two calls is answered on the second call. The
 * precedence is the same for all of them — an explicit option handed in on the call wins, the
 * environment variable sits underneath it, and the built-in default underneath both — so a test
 * that shuts one of them into a temporary directory never has the environment run over it, and a
 * process that states nothing behaves exactly as it did before these switches were read here.
 *
 * The six names and what each one moves:
 *
 * - `PF_HOME_DIR` — the machine layer's home: `<home>/.pf/config.json`, and nothing else.
 * - `PF_PLUGINS_DIR` — the folder one plugin per sub-folder is read from; whitespace is cut off,
 *   a value opening with `~` is expanded to this machine's home (`~` alone is the home itself),
 *   and an empty value means the default `<root>/plugins`.
 * - `DSH_CONDUCT_SPAWNER` — which spawner opens the next session: a bare word (`dsh` / `zcode`)
 *   or a path. A per-call name wins over it, and a line's own `spawner` policy wins over both.
 * - `DSH_CONDUCT_SPAWN_DRY_RUN` — the drill switch: anything but `''`, `0`, `false`, `False` is on.
 * - `DSH_SESSION_ID` — the session id of this process itself: a node registered here notes the
 *   conversation it was born in under that id.
 * - `ZCODE_DATA_BASE_DIR` — the ZCode host's data root; `.zcode` hangs under it, and the path is
 *   only handed out when the spawner that opens the session is the ZCode one.
