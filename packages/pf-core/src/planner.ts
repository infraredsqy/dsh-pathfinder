/**
 * The planner layer: read the graph, the lines, the instructions and the dispatch pieces, and hand back "what
 * the next step is" — a plan, not one byte written.
 *
 * This module is the whole of planning, and its reading is:
 *
 * - **read-only**: it holds no lock, passes no init gate and writes not one byte. The write-side verbs
 *   (closing, claiming, landing the prompt) are not in this module; the plan only answers "who to dispatch /
 *   why it stopped / whether to ask a person".
 * - **derived values do not land**: `ready` = todo, every dependency delivered (a dangling dependency counts
 *   as delivered), and no other line holding it; `running` = a todo some line is holding right now. Both are
 *   labels computed when read; on disk there are only the three states (todo / shelved / completed) and the
 *   line's `holding`; the two things each keep a field of their own and neither explains the other.
 * - **ordering has one place**: the full ordering comes from the graph side (`dag.list`'s urgency ×
 *   importance and its tie order), and this module only deletes rows by readiness, by the line's picking range
 *   and by another line's holdings — it never rewrites the scoring.
 * - **stopping has one place**: the node's own `mode` speaks (`checkpoint` stops at the close, `manual`'s gate
 *   is inside the session, `auto` opens the next one at the close), and a boundary instruction's
 *   `stop_after_nodes` can only tighten that rule. The line's own `when_shelved` decides whether the line goes
 *   on after "this node did not deliver".
 * - **the bytes of a plan are fixed byte for byte**: the action bag's key order is construction order (the
 *   corpus compares directly against the output of `--plan`), and the preview keeps the "mechanical steps not
 *   run yet" outside the action, leaving only one `settling` note — that is the preview rule: **when the
 *   preview is in hand, the mechanical steps are still behind it**.
