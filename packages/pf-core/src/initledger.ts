/**
 * `init` and `register`: the one-shot setup action that lays down `.pf/`, and the two keys that
 * register the merge driver with git.
 *
 * The reading:
 *
 * - **The bottom line first, and unconditional.** Four layout files land — `.pf/.gitignore`,
 *   `.pf/.gitattributes`, `.pf/AGENTS.md` and `.pf/config.json` (the last one only when absent, or
 *   under `force`) — so that when `init` returns, the directory is a pf workspace whatever the
 *   environment: no git, not a checkout, `git init` failing, all alike. Layout files are LF on every
 *   platform and are rewritten from the constants whenever their bytes differ (a hand-broken one is
 *   repaired by re-running, an intact one is not touched at all); every write is atomic.
 * - **The attachments after it, best-effort.** Three things are nice to have and never the
 *   condition of "this is a pf project": a repository of `.pf`'s own, one `info/exclude` line that
 *   keeps `.pf` out of the project repository, and the merge driver's two keys in the project's git
 *   config. Each one that does not happen is named in one sentence of `warnings` — never a throw,
 *   never a rollback.
 * - **git is asked, never guessed at.** All directory-layout knowledge of git (where
 *   `info/exclude` lives, where the repository root is, whether this is a checkout at all) goes
 *   through the injected `GitRunner`. No `.git` file is parsed by hand. A repository of `.pf`'s own
 *   is given only when the caller asks for it (`ownRepo`, the default, own-repo layout only), and
 *   the giving is one `git init --quiet` through the same runner; an existing one is never touched.
 *   Without a runner the git-side attachments are skipped and said so, and a `git init` git refuses
 *   leaves one warning.
 * - **The merge driver's registration is read before it is written.** A registration this machine
 *   really answers — the command form `pf merge-ledger …` with `pf` on `PATH`, the package's own name
 *   form `pf-merge-ledger …` with that command on `PATH`, or the absolute form whose two quoted paths
 *   are both files here — is left exactly as it is (re-running `init` must not silently rewrite a
 *   working driver, a string a person may have chosen on purpose), and the reading says so. Only a
 *   missing or dead registration is replaced, with the command computed at write time: the command
 *   form when `pf` resolves on `PATH` (position-independent, and the form an installed `pf` answers),
 *   the package's name form when only `pf-merge-ledger` does, and the absolute form otherwise (quoted,
 *   `process.execPath` plus this package's built entry). The command now in force is handed back with
 *   the report, so a caller prints what was really written or kept.
