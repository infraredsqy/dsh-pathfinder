/**
 * Assemble the conductor namespace: how the five verbs are wired:
 *
 * - `dispatch`'s **whole dispatch**: the claim of an earlier dispatch is read first — when this
 *   (line, node)'s `started` marker is already on disk the answer is `already_open`, with no executor
 *   call and not one byte written. Otherwise: the plugin blocking seam (a blocker lists every reason
 *   and throws `dispatch_blocked`) → dispatch preparation (`prepareDispatch`: the prompt lands at its
 *   location, the run doc is set up in the node directory, the handoff template comes back with the
 *   material) → build the `DispatchRequest` (the line's and the node's identity carried as they are,
 *   `role` carried by the request, the prompt being the one line preparation handed back) and give it
 *   to the injected executor → take the `OpenedSession` as the receipt and land the claim (`started`),
 *   after which the plan treats this cell as in flight and never dispatches it a second time. An
 *   executor that throws means no session was opened: no marker lands and no record moves. A claim
 *   that cannot be written is **not** a warning: the session is out and nothing on disk says so, so
 *   the call throws with the session id in the message (dispatching the same cell again would open a
 *   second session) — success is never handed back without the claim.
 * - `close`'s **closing settle**: the blockers refuse first (the ticket is missing or still `pending`, so
 *   there is no verdict to settle); the settling criteria are shared with the plan (`settleClose`) — the
 *   verdict goes into path, the claim is laid down, the node lands `completed` / `shelved`, the filled slots
 *   are pinned one by one, and a line decided to stop is turned `inactive` (only recorded when the line is not
 *   in service); the record tree's lock is held throughout, the records that moved get a byte snapshot first,
 *   and a mid-way failure puts them back by the snapshot (no half record is left); the closing insertion seam
 *   runs after the settle as before (zero semantic change). A broken plugin's WARNING hangs on the returned
 *   line record (read with `warningsOf`).
 * - `handoff`'s **landing the ticket**: the line must exist and the node must be on its claim list (otherwise
 *   it refuses having written nothing), and the ticket's six keys land in `signals/<line>/<node>.json` in the
 *   fixed shape and key order (the write is atomic; a second ticket for the same node is legitimate and
 *   overwrites the whole file).
 * - `doctor`'s **strict plugin face**: the bad spots are listed one by one (the declaration, loading the
 *   implementation, the skills, the sources, and a real question put to the implementation against a stand-in
 *   project), plus two tables — a knob shadowing a built-in name, a command claiming a core word; the
 *   **record face** has four more cells: whether `init`'s four layout files are there, whether the graph
 *   has cycles and dangling references, whether the nodes a line holds are still on the graph, and whether
 *   the merge driver's two keys are in this project's git config — that last cell is asked with the git
 *   handed in on this one call (`doctor({ git })`), never with one kept on the handle, and every question it
 *   puts to git carries a bound (`DOCTOR_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS`, narrowed through the namespace options for a caller
 *   that cannot wait it out): a question left unanswered reds that cell and names the question and the wait
 *   instead of holding the whole check-up open, while the other cells are computed all the same.
 *
 * The executor is taken on the green light path of `dispatch`; `next` is still a read-only plan.
