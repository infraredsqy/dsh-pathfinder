/**
 * The cross-process lock: one lock per record tree —
 * `<pf>/meta/ledger.lock`, held through every "read → change → write" so that all writers of
 * records stay out of each other's way. The lock file exists while the lock is held and is empty.
 *
 * How it lands is up to the runtime: byte-range locks (msvcrt / fcntl) are released by the
 * operating system when the process dies, and Node's standard surface does not have one, so
 * exclusive creation is the mutex here — taking the lock is creating an empty file with wx,
 * releasing it is deleting that file. The path, the timeout limit, the polling cadence and the
 * decidable timeout error all follow this one reading; when a holder dies mid-way the lock file
 * stays behind, and the next one waits out the timeout and gets a decidable `lock_timeout`
 * instead of hanging silently.
 *
 * - Waiting has a limit (10 seconds by default), probing every 50 ms whether the file can be
 *   created exclusively; on timeout a `PfError('lock_timeout')` is thrown, nothing was changed,
 *   and who was waited for and how long are both in the error.
 * - The lock is registered by "the resolved lock path". In one process, same-path callers are
 *   serialized on a promise chain: a caller waits for the previous holder of the same path to
 *   release before it reaches the file, so two concurrent writers in one process cannot
 *   interleave their "read → change → write". A call made from inside the holding body is a
 *   re-entry: it stays on the same chain — it runs under the held lock instead of queueing
 *   behind itself — and only the outermost acquire / release touches the file. Re-entry of the
 *   holding process is not mutually exclusive, consistent with this reading (registration
 *   follows the process).
 * - Gatekeeping of the "this record does not allow writes at all" kind (`gate`) belongs to the
 *   init decision.
