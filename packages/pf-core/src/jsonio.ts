 * The only reader and the only writer of `.pf` records. The reading:
 *
 * - **the bytes of one record on disk**: two-space indent; non-ASCII written as it is
 *   (Chinese text in a record stays readable); **LF on every platform** (machine-read bytes
 *   must be the same byte for byte whichever machine wrote them, otherwise a merge of two
 *   sides that say the same thing would still rewrite the whole file); no trailing newline;
 *   key order is given by the caller — the writers of ideas.json and issues.json sort keys
 *   deeply (each writer's own habit), the other records land in construction order. Which
 *   record is sorted is in `jsonOptionsForRecord`.
 * - **a write is atomic**: the temporary file lands in the target's own directory (a
 *   cross-directory rename leaves half a file on the way), created exclusively, written out
 *   and fsynced, then renamed into place; when the rename meets a process that is reading,
 *   it backs off and retries in small steps (within a limit). Any step failing: the
 *   temporary file is cleared, the original file stays as it was, the error is thrown as it
 *   is — a reader sees either the old record or the new one, never half of one.
 * - **a read has only three readings**: present (`kind: 'present'`); missing
 *   (`kind: 'missing'`, whether that counts as empty is up to the caller); unparsable
 *   (throws `PfError`, the code is decidable, never repaired automatically). A read
 *   tolerates unknown fields: whatever parses is handed back, no validation, no rewriting.
