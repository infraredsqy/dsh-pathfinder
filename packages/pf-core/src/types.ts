/**
 * The frozen record types: node, line, instruction, issue, handoff ticket, session file.
 *
 * Key names and value vocabularies are written as `.pf` records are on disk (snake_case key names
 * included): whatever a record on disk looks like, the interface here looks the same. Optional keys land
 * only when their condition holds, and by default no key is written — whatever shape the record has on
 * disk is the shape it has here.
 *
 * There are two timestamp shapes, both UTC with a literal `Z`:
 * - the microsecond shape (`2026-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z`): used by the graph (node records) and by the
 *   records a plugin keeps of its own;
 * - the seconds shape (`2026-01-01T00:00:00Z`): used by lines (state.json), handoff tickets, instructions
 *   and session files.
