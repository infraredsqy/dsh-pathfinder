/**
 * The body of the git merge driver: one three-way merge of one `.pf` record.
 *
 * This file knows three things — which record this is, how to read the bytes of the three sides, and how the
 * merged result lands — and then hands the merge itself to the four engines beside it. It defines no merge rule
 * of its own.
 *
 * Why a driver is needed
 * ----------------------
 * Two machines each run a pipeline and each hold the same record. Every writer rewrites the whole file from the
 * data in memory (two-space indent, sorted keys for `ideas.json`, LF on every platform, no trailing newline), so
 * two records that each changed one field differ on every line: a line-by-line merge reports a false conflict,
 * and worse, "cleanly" merges a mixture that neither side recognises. So the merge happens on the parsed record,
 * and the result is written back through **the same byte writer** (`jsonBytes` + `jsonOptionsForRecord`) — the
 * decision and the bytes come from one place, and the two formats cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Which record this is: the name first, then the shape
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Under git `<ours>` is often git's own temporary file, whose name cannot be recognised, so the driver
 * configuration passes `%P` (the path in the repository) as the fourth argument. When the name cannot be
 * recognised the shape decides: the three that carry a `nodes` / `cycles` / `instructions` collection key, or a
 * handoff ticket ("it has a status, and no collection underneath"). A file recognised by neither is refused.
 *
 * Where the record tree is: git says so, the driver does not assume
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * git runs a merge driver at the top of the working tree, and a project may sit several directories below that
 * (or a checkout may hold several projects). The record tree is therefore located from `%P` — the directory in
 * front of its `.pf` segment, joined onto the driver's working directory, and confirmed to hold an init-ed
 * `.pf` — and, when no `%P` came in, by walking up from the working directory to the nearest init-ed `.pf`. When
 * neither locates one, the driver says plainly that no `.pf` sits at that position instead of judging a conflict
 * it cannot place; a `%P` that names a position with no record tree is exactly that case, not "a record tree that
 * was never init-ed".
 *
 * The exit codes, and what git does with them
 * -------------------------------------------
 *   0  merged and written into `<ours>` (or nothing needed doing)
 *   1  needs a human decision (or the record tree's lock never came free): not one byte was written, so git
 *      keeps `<ours>` and records this merge as a conflict
 *   2  a usage or read error: the file does not read as a record (it does not parse, its shape is wrong), a side
 *      is there but cannot be read at all, or there is no record tree at the position git named
