/**
 * `ideas.json` — the graph: node status, text fields, and the dependency edges between nodes.
 *
 * One node per row, keyed by uuid. What this engine adds on top of the generic walk:
 *
 * - if both sides moved `status`, the higher rung wins (`todo < shelved < completed`); a word outside the
 *   vocabulary is a conflict, never a guess.
 * - `dependencies` takes the union, but only when **neither side removed an edge**: an edge one side cut and the
 *   other added is a disagreement about the same edge, and nobody but a person can judge it.
 * - `title` / `description` / `mode` / `tags` follow "the later write wins", on the evidence of `updated_at` (the
 *   timestamp every writer touches); when the two timestamps cannot be ordered, it is a conflict.
 * - one side takes the node off the graph and the other leaves it alone: it stays off (this is the one record whose
 *   deletions propagate); one side takes it off and the other edited it: a conflict.
 * - after the merge, an edge left in the result whose target node is not there records a conflict
 *   (`flagBrokenDependency`) — the pipeline reads a dangling edge as **already satisfied**.
