/**
 * `state.json` — lines: one record per line, plus the `path` of the nodes it walked through.
 *
 * A record indexed by `id`, with the merged result written back as a list (this file is list-shaped). What this
 * engine adds on top of the generic walk:
 *
 * - `path` is append-only: when one side is a prefix of the other take the longer one, and two different tails are
 *   unioned by the order they were walked; the same node recorded twice with two different verdicts is a conflict
 *   (that rule is handed to `extendOrUnion`).
 * - `status` is `active` / `inactive`: both sides naming one word each really is a disagreement, judged by a person
 *   — never a coin toss.
 * - line entries are never deleted: neither side's engine has a command that deletes one, so an absent entry is
 *   "this side never had it" and it comes back (`propagateDelete` off).
