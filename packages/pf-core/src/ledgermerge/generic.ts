 * this" and "how does a decision get said out loud".
 *
 * Nothing here knows the fields of any one record; the four engines beside it are the ones that recognise fields.
 *
 * The decision reading (fixed point by point):
 *
 *   ours == theirs          both sides agree, take it, not a problem
 *   ours == base            only the other side changed it, take the other side
 *   theirs == base          only this side changed it, take this side
 *   both changed, differently  `UNDECIDED`, the engine sets the rule, and with no rule it records a conflict for a
 *                              person to judge
 *
 * A record becomes a problem only when both sides changed the same field to two different values: a field only one
 * side touched is asked about by nobody.
