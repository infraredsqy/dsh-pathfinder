/**
 * Dispatch preparation: the first half of `conductor.dispatch` — the material for one run, all of it
 * settled here.
 *
 * - **The prompt**: what dispatch hands to the session is one line of invocation
 *   (`/pf-conduct <node id> [pipeline]`, spelled byte for byte). Nothing comes after that line, and
 *   nothing may be padded in front of it: the node's mode, title and spec path are read by the session
 *   itself from the node record, the closing command and the ticket shape belong to the skill being
 *   called, and the standing instructions are read by the session itself with `pf instruction list` —
 *   none of that is in the prompt. It lands in the matching
 *   `<pf>/meta/launch/<line>/<node>/prompt.txt`, atomic write, whole file overwritten (idempotent).
 * - **The run doc**: this round's run document, landing in the node directory
 *   (`<pf>/nodes/<node>/run.md`). Its sections follow the run.md reading — "what was done",
 *   "self-decisions", "known unresolved", "verified facts" are the four fixed sections; this
 *   preparation step fills in "verified facts" (the node's mode/weight/tags, the spec's location and
 *   its `method:` line, this line's status/tags/policies/holding, three settings readings, and the
 *   instructions in force that are visible from the current position), and the other three sections
 *   are left for this round's session to write. Every word comes from records and the spec, nothing is
 *   improvised; the first preparation sets the document up by exclusive creation and later ones
 *   leave it alone (once written it belongs to the session), and a repeated preparation does not
 *   produce a second one.
 * - **The handoff template**: what this line wants, and which verdict words there are. The fields and
 *   verdict words follow the fixed shape (`handoff --form` prints: `deliverable` / `acceptance` /
 *   `touched`, verdicts `completed | failed | stopped`); the CLI that precedes this library prints it on a
 *   command line and this library has no command line, so the template is a piece of text handed back with the
 *   rest of the material and not landed on disk.
 * - **Only dispatch plans are accepted**: preparation reads a read-only plan first; when what the plan
 *   hands back is not a dispatch (the line has no node to pin, the sessions were all opened already, the
 *   ticket is not in yet), there is no material to prepare and it says so on the spot, writing not one
 *   byte. Pinning (`open_node`'s claim) and handing the request to the executor are the other two
 *   write-side steps and are not in this half of the action.
 *
 * The runtime export surface reaches this block through `conductor.prepare` (the material landed, no
 * session opened); `conductor.dispatch` is the same block behind its own gates, followed by the
 * executor and the claim — and it skips the block altogether when the prompt it would land is already
 * on disk, because then the pinning step landed it and there is nothing left to prepare.
