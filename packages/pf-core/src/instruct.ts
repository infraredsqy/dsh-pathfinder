/**
 * The real implementation of the instructions namespace: register, list, resolve, revive, remove
 * (leaving a tombstone). Behaviour and on-disk bytes are fixed point by point:
 *
 * - every verb that changes instructions.json holds the record tree's lock through the whole
 *   "read → change → write"; the init gate comes before the lock (the gate sits before the lock
 *   creates any directory, so a `.pf` that was never initialised gets not one byte). Read-side
 *   verbs (list) hold no lock and ask no gate: writes are atomic, and a never-laid-down instruction
 *   account reads as an empty one.
 * - instructions.json is read and rewritten as a whole document: the instructions own only the
 *   `instructions` table, and every other top-level key (foreign sections) is carried back as it
 *   was; the `removed` tombstone table only appears on disk once something was really removed.
 *   Key order lands in the writer's construction order (no sorting); the timestamps of instruction
 *   records are always the seconds shape.
 * - visibility is pure derivation: an entry is in scope only while it is live and its binding has
 *   not lapsed (the bound line is still active, the bound node is not completed). The scope decision
 *   is not landed on disk, it is computed on every read — when a line leaves service or a node is
 *   delivered, the instructions bound to them drop out of the reading by themselves, with no
 *   "change the state when the time comes" write of any kind.
 * - the direction of the scope reading: global is visible everywhere; a bound cycle / node is
 *   compared exactly against where the reader stands (when the position can be given), and without a
 *   position it falls back to a wide read — the bound line is still active, the bound node is not
 *   completed, so it counts as visible. An unrecognised scope word and an empty binding both read
 *   towards "visible": missing a real constraint costs far more than reading one row too many.
 * - the binding at registration follows the position: a cycle / node the caller names is checked
 *   first (the line must be in the line account; a named node must be on the graph when the graph is
 *   non-empty — an empty graph has nothing to check against and is let through), and without a name
 *   the single active line and the node it holds are taken; a cycle / node scope with no binding to
 *   record is refused — an entry without a binding would be read as "visible everywhere, never
 *   lapsing", which is exactly what the scope exists to prevent.
 * - removal leaves a tombstone: the entry leaves the account together with its text, and `removed`
 *   keeps the id and the timestamp (no text, no state word); an issued id is never issued again —
 *   the next id is "the highest issued + 1", and tombstones count too.
 * - the reading has two shapes, one verb: by default it is the reader-facing view — the live entries
 *   visible from where the reader stands, in account order, folded to the three structural words
 *   (`scope`, `target`, `reach`) plus text and id. The account switches (`all` / `live` / `scope`)
 *   hand back the raw rows, also in account order. Visibility is the same decision either way.
