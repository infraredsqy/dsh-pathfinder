/**
 * The declaration surface and the runtime contract of plugins: the kinds, the timings, the actions, the closed
 * sets of declaration keys, the shape of an offer / gate / command, and the context the host hands to an
 * implementation. The closed sets and vocabularies are fixed cell by cell:
 *
 * - **four kinds and no others** (number / integer / word / switch): a declared kind cell may only use these
 *   four, and a fifth would be a change to the core that must not come in with a plugin.
 * - **two timings** (close / dispatch) and **two actions** (insert / block), the two axes making one cell: the
 *   cells the core really serves are only (close, insert) and (dispatch, block). A declaration outside that table
 *   is refused as a declaration problem, so every cell the vocabulary accepts is one a gate really asks about.
 * - **a declaration is a pure data file**: listing, help and the check-up all read it, and loading never
 *   executes it; the implementation (the impl entry) is another thing in the folder, called only by a timing's
 *   gate.
 * - the seam has only two timings: the close insertion and the dispatch block. A timing the runtime never asks
 *   about is not in the vocabulary at all — the vocabulary and the table above are one set, not two, so no
 *   declaration passes the check on a cell that can never fire.
