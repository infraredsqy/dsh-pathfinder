/**
 * The core mechanism that turns an offer into a real node on the graph: set the node up, write its text, wire the
 * edges — "the declaration says what it wants, the mechanism says how it lands":
 *
 * 1. **the uuid**: `ledger.dag.add` mints and returns it in this process (no subprocess printing a uuid back: the
 *    dag namespace here is in the same process, and the return value carries the id directly);
 * 2. **the spec**: the generated text is written into the new node's `spec.md` — the node's session opens much
 *    later, and the text lands in the same step as the node;
 * 3. **the edges**: `after` (the node being closed) → the new node; and `before` (the node originally picked) is
 *    re-hung onto the new node. The old edge of `before` is taken off first (without tearing it the graph would
 *    cycle and the graph namespace would refuse), and that is exactly how an insertion voids this close's pick.
 *
 * **The description cell's reading is fixed**: the whole spec first goes through one JSON string encoding and
 * then into the description cell (the description is handed to the graph namespace as one argument and lands
 * there as it is, so the generated description is a JSON literal with quotes and escapes; both sides use this
 * reading at the same moment, which is why the bytes line up).
 *
 * An insertion is a graph edit and nothing more: it opens no session, does not move the line's hand and pins no
 * node. Every offer lands on its own and is contained on its own: one exploding offer spends only itself (one
 * WARNING line) and the rest still enter the graph.
