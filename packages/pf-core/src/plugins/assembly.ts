/**
 * One assembly of the plugin directory, for one use: the folder scan and the tables read off it are worked
 * out once and handed to every point of that use, so a step that asks for the declarations and then for the
 * folders does not read the directory twice.
 *
 * The memo lives exactly as long as the assembly does, and every use makes its own. The folder on disk is the
 * only answer: a plugin installed or removed, a knob added, a command word changed, all have to be visible on
 * the next use, which is the freshness the check-up states out loud. Sharing one assembly among the points of
 * a single call is the whole of the sharing here; keeping one on a handle across calls would make the folder
 * on disk stop being the answer, so nothing does that.
