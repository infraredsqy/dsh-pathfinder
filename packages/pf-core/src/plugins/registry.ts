 *
 * - the spellings of the declaration file and of the implementation entry are fixed on the TS side as
 *   `plugin.json` and `impl.mjs` (.mjs guarantees ESM regardless of whether the host project has a
 *   package.json); the implementation is loaded into this process by dynamic import, one module object per file
 *   (register + reuse), and a load failure is recorded in the runtime problem table for doctor to report,
 *   never thrown into the main flow.
 * - the refusal of unknown keys is spelled out in the spec, and the reading errs strict: the top level of a
 *   declaration and every cell's keys go through their own closed set, and a key outside the set is one
 *   declaration problem.
 *
 * **Tolerant at runtime, strict in doctor.** Declaration problems and load failures all come back as sentences
 * and nobody throws along the way: the pipeline must not be cut in half by a broken plugin mid-way. The scan is
 * not cached — the folder on disk is the only answer, so a plugin installed or removed is visible on the next
