/**
 * The two timings each ask their own question:
 *
 *     insertions(timing, ctx)   "is there anything to put into the graph now?" → a table of offers
 *     gates(timing, ctx)        "may the next step go?"                        → a table of reason sentences
 *
 * **Tolerant at runtime, strict in doctor.** A plugin that throws is not allowed to stop somebody else's
 * project: every failure turns into one WARNING line (data), that plugin produces nothing this round, and the
 * pipeline goes on as usual. `enable_knob` is gated here in one place: a switch that resolves to off skips this
 * plugin and nothing its implementation says counts; an unreadable switch counts as off — a plugin whose own
 * switch is broken is not a plugin that should be acting.
 *
 * An offer's shape is checked here, before the graph edit happens: a half offer that got into the edit would
 * only blow up in the edit once the close has landed, which is the one moment the pipeline cannot take back.
 * Each cell is checked by the type the edit will use, and one wrong cell spends this plugin's round (one
 * warning naming the cell), on the same footing as throwing.
