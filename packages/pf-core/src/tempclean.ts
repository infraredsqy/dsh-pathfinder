/**
 * The temp sweep (the piece `pf clean-temp` runs): list or delete each node's process-artifact
 * directory `nodes/<id>/temp/`.
 *
 * One place is swept, and only this one: the nodes dir of the record tree handed in. The worktrees
 * area (`<pf>/worktrees/`) is not entered, because nothing under it is provably ours: a checkout of
 * a project set up here does carry its `.pf` records when the layout is in-repo, but no `temp/` cell
 * of ours — `temp/` is kept out of the repository by the record dir's own `.gitignore` — and a
 * directory name is user data, not a provenance record.
 *
 * Only this one cell is touched: spec, reports, run doc, session notes and the rest of the tree
 * stay as they are. Nodes a line holds (`holding` in `state.json`) are skipped unless `force` — raw
 * output there may be being written at this moment. An unreadable `state.json` refuses the whole
 * thing and touches no temp: reading it as "no one holds anything" and going ahead is the worst kind
 * of silent error.
