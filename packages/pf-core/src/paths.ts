/**
 * The `.pf` directory layout: the record directory, the four records, the signals directory, node
 * directories, metadata and session files.
 *
 * Every write location is given by the constants and functions here; no arbitrarily spelled path
 * string is accepted as a location. Item by item (the record directory, the four records, and the
 * separate locations of session files and the issue pool):
 *
 *   <root>/.pf/                        record directory
 *     state.json                         lines (the `cycles` table)
 *     ideas.json                         nodes (the `nodes` table)
 *     instructions.json                  instructions
 *     issues/issues.json                 issue pool (the `issues` table; kept in the issues/ subdirectory)
 *     config.json                        project-layer settings (init lays down an empty object; the machine layer is `<home>/.pf/config.json`)
 *     signals/<line>/<node>.json         handoff tickets
 *     nodes/<node>/                      node directory (spec, run.md run doc, report group, temp/; `config.json` is a settings layer of one node's own)
 *     worktrees/<short id>/              the worktree of one node under the parallel mode (one checkout per node, removed after the merge back at closing)
 *     meta/                              where the pipeline pieces live (cross-process lock, session files, dispatch pieces)
 *       ledger.lock                      cross-process lock (present while held, an empty file)
 *       sessions/<node>.json             session file
 *       launch/<line>/<node>/prompt.txt  the prompt handed to the session at dispatch (written by dispatch later)
 *       launch/<line>/<node>/started     the marker of a successful dispatch: this node's session is already running

/**
 * One node id is one directory or file name inside a record directory. An id carrying a path separator,

 * empty string joins to the directory itself, `..` to the pf directory, a separator to anywhere at all —
 * so it is refused here, at the one place an id becomes a path. Every builder below that takes a node id
 * runs it through this guard: the settings layer, spec, run doc and temp paths through `nodeDir`, and the
 * signal, session-file and launch paths on their own. A raw caller string is never handed to `join`.
 * Line ids are not guarded here: each caller of `signalPath` / `launchDir` takes its cycle id out of a
 * record the state reader has already resolved (`findCycle`, `resolveCycle`), so a line id that reaches
 * these builders is one the record holds.
 *
 * Through the setting verbs an empty id never gets this far: the layer pointer (`layerPointOf`) drops an
 * empty `node` / `cycle` string, finds no layer named, and refuses the call as a `TypeError`. What those
 * verbs hand to `node_not_found` is the other spellings — a separator, or a `.` / `..` segment — and this
 * guard's empty-id arm answers a caller that reaches a path builder directly.
