/**
 * Two products, two configurations:
 *
 * - `dist/index.mjs` — the library itself, its declarations beside it, unchanged in name and shape;
 * - `dist/merge-ledger.mjs` — the package's one executable entry (`pf-merge-ledger`), which git
 *   calls as a merge driver. Its first line is the shebang npm's shims execute, injected here so
 *   the source file stays plain TypeScript; npm's own shims are generated at install time from the
 *   `bin` entry of `package.json`, which is the only executable entry this package has.
 *
 * The second build must not clean the first product away, so `clean` is turned off there.
