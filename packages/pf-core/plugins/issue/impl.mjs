/**
 * The issue plugin's own implementation: the judgement and the node's body, plus the command entry
 * point.
 *
 * The host loads this file by path (the `plugin.json` beside it is its declaration), so it imports
 * nothing from the engine: everything it touches is brought by the `ctx` handed in —
 *
 *     ctx.knob(name)            the effective value of one knob down the whole chain
 *     ctx.reading(key)          the number behind one declared reading; the source it claims is the
 *                               function that supplies it (the `pool_weight` below), so the pool's
 *                               own number arrives this way
 *     ctx.nodesWithTag(tag)     the ids of nodes still open (todo) carrying one tag
 *     ctx.capture(argv)         run one command inside this process and hand back its output
 *     ctx.specPath(node_id)     where one node's spec.md lands (this tree's own layout)
 *     ctx.root / ctx.cycle / ctx.nodeId / ctx.sig / ctx.dag / ctx.target
 *
 * **This file belongs to this plugin alone**: reading the declaration, pairing it with the prose
 * below, comparing the number against the line, assembling the offer, writing the node's title and
 * body — all of it here; on the engine's side there is only merging names, looking for collisions,
 * and the insertion mechanism that turns an offer into a node.
 *
 * `offer(ctx)` is the whole contract between this file and the engine: hand back the insertion this
 * pass wants (title, tags, body builder, a line of why), or `null` (the usual answer). It does not
 * land a byte, does not open a session, and does not stop for a number it cannot read: a project with
 * no line configured gets `null` here — so a close in a project that never configured a line stays
 * byte-for-byte what it was before this plugin existed.
 *
 * **The pool's weight is not reported by the session.** This plugin claims the source it takes the
 * number from (`sources` in `plugin.json`) and names the function below that computes it, so the
 * number comes in through `ctx.reading` — the pool's tools are therefore this folder's own business,
 * and the engine does not have to know. A number that cannot be read counts as "not known this pass",
 * never as 0: reading it as 0 would make a real debt look paid off.
