/**
 * The test-audit plugin's own implementation: the judgement, plus the node's own body (the reading,
 * the threshold, the dedup tag, the body verbatim).
 *
 * The core loads this file **by path**, so it is a module of its own: it and the `plugin.json` beside
 * it (this plugin's declaration) are the two things in one folder, and beyond that it imports nothing
 * from this repository — everything it can touch is in the `ctx` handed to it (`PluginContext`):
 *
 *     await ctx.knob(name)      the effective value of one knob down the whole chain
 *     await ctx.reading(key)    the number one declared reading answers with (the one the ticket reports)
 *     ctx.nodesWithTag(tag)     the ids of nodes still open (todo) carrying this tag
 *     ctx.specPath(nodeId)      where one node's spec.md lands (this tree's own layout, not a guess here)
 *     ctx.cycle / ctx.nodeId / ctx.sig / ctx.dag / ctx.target
 *
 * **This file is this plugin's own.** Reading the declaration, pairing it with the prose table below,
 * comparing the number against the line, assembling the offer, writing the node's title and body — all
 * of it is here; the other one in the same batch of plugins (the one watching the issue pool) carries
 * its own copy of the same machinery: this thing is not shared between plugins, and it is not lifted
 * into the core either. The core merges names, looks for collisions, and turns an offer into a node in
 * `src/plugins/insertion.ts`.
 *
 * `offer(ctx)` is the whole contract between it and the core: the insertion wanted right now (title,
 * tags, body builder, plus its own two lines), or `null` — the common one. It never writes a file,
 * never opens a session, and never throws because a number is missing: the close of a project with no
 * line configured gets `null` here, which is where "a close without the plugin is the same bytes as
 * before" comes from.
 *
 * **A number may be missing, and a number that cannot be read counts as "not known this pass".** The
 * line lives in its own knob (`knobs.test_seconds_limit` in the declaration, judged at whichever layer
 * of the chain states it), and the ticket carries the wall clock the session measured. Reading a
 * missing number as 0 would make a real debt look paid off, so it reads as absent.
