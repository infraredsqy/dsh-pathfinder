/**
 * A directory hash: every entry's relative path and content, sorted by name, fed into sha256 one
 * after another. Any byte of a record changing changes the hash; anything outside the records is
 * none of its business. It backs the invariant "the repo root .pf hash is the same before and
 * after the full suite".
 *
 * Three kinds of directory are skipped: a top-level `worktrees/`, a top-level `meta/`, and a
 * `temp/` at any depth (per the layout in `src/paths.ts`, `temp` only appears at
 * `nodes/<id>/temp`). They are the areas the pf tool runs itself (`.pf/.gitignore` takes them out
 * of the repository too): `worktrees/` holds the forked node work areas, where vitest caches and
 * temp files keep changing while a parallel line runs tests in them; `meta/` holds cross-process
 * locks, session notes and dispatch papers, written by the tool itself; `nodes/<id>/temp/` holds
 * each node's probes and raw output. The sentinel protects records under the invariant "engine
 * operations must not land in the repo root .pf" -- writes into these tool-run areas are not
 * covered, and hashing them would let a parallel line's ordinary work trip the sentinel by
 * mistake.
 *
 * A directory that does not exist comes back as a fixed sentinel: absent before and absent after
 * means consistent; a directory appearing out of nowhere mid-run is still caught. The records
 * themselves do travel with a checkout (the in-repo layout puts them in the repository); the cell a
 * checkout never carries is a node's `temp/` one, kept out by the record dir's own `.gitignore`.
