/**
 * Golden corpus replayer: one set of input records + one operation → byte-for-byte comparison of
 * the expected products.
 *
 * Case convention: `tests/fixtures/<case name>/` holds one
 * directory per case — `input/` holds the records from before the operation (relative to the
 * project root, tokenised; absent means empty input), `op.json` holds one operation (action path +
 * positional args) and `expected/` holds the expected products after the operation (the products of
 * that same operation, tokenised).
 *
 * The token rules are one set shared by the generation side and the replay side:
 * - node ids: each `@node-a@…` in the input takes a fresh uuid (allocated in token-name order); ids
 *   the operation newly creates continue from the highest existing letter in appearance order
 *   (`@node-e@…`). Id tokens appear in two places: in record bodies and in record file names (a
 *   handoff lands in `signals/<cycle>/<node>.json`, and the file name carries the node id).
 *   The **eight-character short id used to refer to a node** in a product (such as `a5c1de00`)
 *   takes its own `@short-a@…`: letters are allocated in appearance order (the same continuation
 *   as `@node-a@`), one short form, one token. Full ids and short ids are numbered separately, so
 *   how far an id is truncated is pinned by the comparison — printing the full id, or ten
 *   characters of it, shows up as a difference.
 * - project root: `@root@`. Planning products write the absolute path of the project root into
 *   their body (the landing spot of the prompt), and both sides swap it for this token; a JSON body
 *   carries the escaped spelling, so the swap is done on the escaped one too.
 * - timestamps: `@tN@` in the input takes a stamp stepping from a base point
 *   (2020-01-01T00:00:00Z plus N seconds, strictly earlier than the "now" the operation writes);
 *   which spelling one token materialises to follows the record shape — the graph and issues (micro
 *   form) spell down to the microsecond, while cycles, instructions, handoffs and session notes
 *   (seconds form) are truncated to the second. In a product an input stamp becomes its original
 *   token again, while a stamp the operation newly wrote takes the next number after the highest
 *   one, in ascending value order (`@t6@…`); both spellings are recognised.
 * - both sides put the records through the same formatting (`jsonBytes`, deep-sorted keys for ideas /
 *   issues) and then fold to LF for the byte compare; layout and other non-record files are folded
 *   to LF and compared directly. A failure points at the line number and context of the first
 *   difference.
 *
 * Some operations produce a **return value** (the plan of `conductor.next` lands in the return
 * value) and write no record file: `op.json` says `"expect": "return"`, and the replayer serialises
 * the return value with two-space indentation, tokenises it, and compares it with
 * `expected/return.json` byte for byte. Older cases leave that cell out and compare product files
 * only, as before.
 *
 * A case whose product carries the **current date** (the default cycle title `Cycle <YYYY-MM-DD>`
 * is derived from the clock) declares a **clock pin**: `op.json` says `"clock": "<ISO instant>"`, and
 * every timestamp the operation writes is derived from that instant instead of the wall clock. The
 * expectation can then hold the date literally and the case stays green on any day. Cases without a
 * pin read the real clock, exactly as before.
