/**
 * The global guard for the whole suite: shut the machine layer into a fresh temporary sandbox, then
 * record the hash of the repo root `.pf` before the run, recompute it at teardown and compare.
 *
 * - The machine layer (`PF_HOME_DIR`) is a **sandbox created here**, not merely cleared: with the
 *   switch absent the layer is the real `~/.pf/config.json`, and one case that reads a stored word
 *   there would make the suite answer to the machine it runs on (`session_host_override` is the one
 *   that bites: it is a machine-wide knob, and the node detail's session lists go through it). An
 *   empty sandbox reads exactly like a machine that stores nothing, which is what every case here
 *   assumes. It goes away again at teardown.
 * - `PF_PLUGINS_DIR` is cleared and **not** pointed anywhere: the two plugins the repo carries
 *   (`plugins/`) travel with the tree and are what the plugin and doctor cases stand on, so hiding
 *   them would take those cases' premise away. A case that needs the switch sets it itself and puts
 *   it back.
 * - Engine operations belong in temp dirs; whoever lands a change inside the repo root `.pf` fails
 *   the whole suite.
