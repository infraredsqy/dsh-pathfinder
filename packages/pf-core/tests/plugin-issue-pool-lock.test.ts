 * The pool's one-writer rule inside one process.
 *
 * One process runs commands side by side; when two of them take their snapshot of the pool before
 * either write landed, the pool comes back without one of the two issues and nobody is told. The
 * overlap is brought about for real below: the first write misses its rename once, which sends it
 * back for the retry the atomic write already backs off from — while it waits, the second command
 * runs all the way through unless something queues it.
 *
 * The "rename blocked" step is forced through a module double: everything but `renameSync` is the
 * real implementation (the plugin reads and writes with `node:fs`'s synchronous surface).
