/**
 * The lock boundary of one close: the plugin half — the scan, the dynamic load, every plugin's
 * question — is done before the lock is taken, on one snapshot of the scene; under the lock the line
 * and the ticket are read again, the settle answers to those bytes, and what is left in there is the
 * record write.
 *
 * The four invariants this file locks:
 *
 * - a plugin that takes its time answering does not keep another writer **in this process** waiting:
 *   its question is not asked inside the lock, so the other writer lands while the plugin is parked;
 * - a ticket rewritten in that window — here by the plugin that got its turn first — is the one the
 *   settle answers to: the verdict comes from the bytes read under the lock, not from the ones the
 *   plugin half was handed.
 * - the graph snapshot the plugin judges on is the one taken before the lock: the node this very
 *   close is closing is still `todo` in it, so a plugin whose gate asks `nodesWithTag` counts the
 *   closing node itself and stays shut;
 * - the ticket is read a third time under the lock, and a plugin that takes the cell's ticket away
 *   (or leaves it stating `pending`) in the window is refused with `nothing_to_settle`, before the
 *   record snapshot and before any write.
 *
 * The implementation of these plugins is written by the test itself (the lab writer lays the
 * declaration beside it), and every tree a test touches is a temporary project root.
