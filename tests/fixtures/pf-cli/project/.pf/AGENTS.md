This directory is the pf pipeline's ledger: `ideas.json`, `state.json`, `instructions.json` and
`signals/` are the pipeline's records, and `nodes/<uuid>/` holds the spec and the deliverable of
each slot (DAG node).

- Records are read and written only through `pf` (`pf dag …`, `pf next`); hand-editing the JSON is forbidden, and so is reading `ideas.json` raw -- use the tool's list / plan output.
- Process artifacts belonging to one slot (probes, raw output, self-check scripts) go in `.pf/nodes/<uuid>/temp/`, which is temporary and not committed: do not submit them as deliverables.
- Everything else temporary goes in `.tmp/` at the workspace root.
- `meta/`, `worktrees/` and `nodes/<id>/temp/` are kept out of the repository by `.gitignore`; do not move anything from inside them out by hand and commit it.
