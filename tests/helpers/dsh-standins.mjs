 * `base` / `user` ride along `undefined`: the real snapshot carries them, and the reader treats
 * absent and undefined alike; a fixture measuring THEM stands its own face up.
 *
 * @param watchCount - adds `watching()`: the subscriber count, so "was the disposer returned" is
 *   judged by count alone (the render check's need).
 * @param writeLog - adds `writes` (every `mutate` recorded), `notify()` (wake subscribers without
 *   touching a byte — the "unchanged means no notification" path) and `bump()` (someone else moved
 *   the revision before this side read — the stale-fence path). The client-prefs tests' need.
