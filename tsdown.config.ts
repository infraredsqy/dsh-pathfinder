/**
 * One entry, for the host half: tsc compiles src/host to lib/types, then tsdown bundles it into lib/host/index.js.
 * The shape mirrors DSH's own plugin packages (entry taken from compiled output; format/platform/target match theirs).
 * This config covers only the host half: the table below carries that single entry.
 *
 * The browser half is src/client/ (five source files plus its own tsconfig and virtual.d.ts, seven in all);
 * tsdown does not build it — tools/build-client.mjs scopes the styles down to the panel layer and bundles them
 * into lib/client.js with rolldown (`npm run bundle:client`), wired via package.json's `exports["./client"]`.
