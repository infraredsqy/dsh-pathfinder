# dsh-pathfinder — Port the agent-pathfinder pipeline into DSH as a work panel the user can see

> This file is a signpost, capped at 15 lines: one line per entry — only what this layer holds and when to read it.

**Read [docs/design-principles.md](docs/design-principles.md) before changing the UI** — that is this repo's law.

- `src/client/styles/` — The panel's own sheets, in the shape they ship in: every selector already carries its layer class. The single source of the panel's look; read before changing the layout
- `design/` — Gitignored local snapshot of the design blueprint: page-shaped sheets, the four pages, their data, and the two generators that refresh it (`design/tools/`). Its pages link `tools/theme.css`. Read when redrawing the look by hand
- `src/` — Host half, model layer, and browser half: how records are read in, how readings are computed, how the panel is drawn, how a node's session is opened (see `src/AGENTS.md`). Read when changing data fetching, the session opener, or the UI
- `tests/` — Unit tests; `npm test` runs them and the engine package's own suite in one command (see `tests/AGENTS.md`)
- `tools/` — Where records come from, how artifacts are built, how the testbed starts (see `tools/AGENTS.md`)
- `docs/` — This repo's law (read before touching the UI) and publishing practice (see `docs/AGENTS.md`)
- `docs/publish.md` — 发版口径：**发版本要先经人明确同意**，也不为验证配置专门发一版（验证只在下一次真发版时顺带完成）
- Package and build surface — `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `packages/pf-core/` (the engine package), `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.host.json`, `tsdown.config.ts`, `cordis.patch.yml`: how the two entries are emitted, how the engine package is reached and inlined, how this line gets hooked into the profile, what the git install route needs authorized. Read when changing the publishing surface
- `.tmp/` — Process artifacts, gitignored: screenshots, probes, per-round notes; jot and toss
