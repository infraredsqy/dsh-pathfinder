/**
 * Why a browser-side operation was refused, as a code rather than a sentence.
 *
 * The panel is the only place that knows which language its reader looks at, so it is the only
 * place that can write a sentence. Everything that can refuse an operation therefore refuses with a
 * code: the host half does (see `src/host/failure.ts`), and this half does for the reasons that
 * belong to the port itself — a channel that is not connected, an endpoint that is not there, an
 * answer that cannot be read.
 *
 * One vocabulary covers both, because a caller holding a refusal should not have to know which half
 * produced it: the panel spells any of these codes the same way (`src/client/words.ts`).
