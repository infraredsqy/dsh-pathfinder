/**
 * The sixth pane of the main panel: this workspace's own project settings.
 *
 * Two objects, side by side: an index down the left edge naming one category per line (with how many
 * rows each holds), and the page the rows stand on. A row is the key's name over its one sentence,
 * the value at the right, and a small tag saying which layer the value lives on. The page is read in
 * two columns while it can hold them and one full-width column when it cannot — the width decides
 * that, not the window, so a narrow panel is not left with a stranded column.
 *
 * Both reading and writing go through the tool: which keys exist, the valid values, and "which
 * layer a value comes from" are all printed by the tool; row order and category follow this side's
 * table, and writes land on this project's layer. This layer makes no second set of judgments — the
 * tool says whether keys and values are valid. No optimistic updates on the page: controls always
 * show the most recently read-back reading; a change is written, then read again, and when the tool
 * refuses, the control returns to its place on its own.
