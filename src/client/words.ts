 * a gate's kind is `checkpoint`, three prerequisites are owed, a moment was two days ago), and this
 * layer says *how it reads*. Nothing here computes a reading, and nothing in the model spells a
 * sentence — which is what lets a second language be added without touching the model at all.
 *
 * Every function takes its translator as its first argument rather than reaching for one. That is
 * deliberate: a caller can be handed a translator from anywhere, the unit tests can pass a
 * lookup table directly, and there is no module-level language for a component to accidentally read
 * on a stale frame.
