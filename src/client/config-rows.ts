 * grow out of the `pf config list` reading.
 *
 * No JSX and no DOM here, so it can be measured standalone where no browser is installed. The tool
 * is the single source of settings keys, so this file does not declare "which keys the tool has":
 * every key in the reading gets a row — registered keys are described per this table, unregistered
 * ones show the key name directly with a text box; keys absent from the reading get no row here —
 * nothing is drawn for what does not exist.
 *
 * A row's category is part of its description here, not a reading-time guess: the settings page
 * stands an index down its left edge, one line per category, and each line's count is how many rows
 * that category holds.
 *
 * The names a row carries are dictionary KEYS, never the words themselves: which language they read
 * in is decided where the row is drawn, by the translator handed to {@link rowWords}.
