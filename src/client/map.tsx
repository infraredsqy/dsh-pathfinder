/**
 * The map: one page that answers "who owes whom" and "which card to look at now", on one drawing.
 *
 * The reading comes in from the shell; this file holds only what a reader does with it — which line
 * to search under (the rail), which card is in focus, and where the camera stands. The placement and
 * the camera arithmetic live in `map-layout.ts`, so what stands here is the interaction: a wheel —
 * or two fingers pinched — zooms, a drag pans, a press on a card moves the focus, and a press on the
 * card already in focus goes to that card's session.
 *
 * Nothing here computes a reading: a rank, a lit set and a gate word are all read from the model and
 * from `map-layout.ts`.
