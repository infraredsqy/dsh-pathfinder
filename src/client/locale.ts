/**
 * The panel's language port: where the reader's language comes from, and how a component asks for
 * one word.
 *
 * DSH already owns the language preference — its settings page has a Language row, it remembers the
 * choice in the Host's user-settings document, and it falls back to the browser's own language and
 * then to English. A plugin does not need a second mechanism for any of that: it registers its
 * dictionaries under a namespace and binds a translate function. So this file registers the panel's
 * lookup tables with `ctx.locale` and binds through it when that service is there, and serves the
 * bundled fallback table when it is not.
 *
 * The fallback is not a stub. Deployments without the locale service (an older DSH, a test harness,
 * a stand-alone panel) get the same behaviour the panel had before it was translatable: Chinese,
 * read straight from the bundled table. That keeps every word on the panel defined in every
 * deployment — a missing service degrades the feature, never the copy.
 *
 * The port deliberately mirrors `prefs.ts`: a snapshot that only changes identity when something
 * truly changed, a `subscribe`, and a module-level default so a component is readable before
 * anything attached. This file stays `.ts` and builds its components with `React.createElement`:
 * Node loads `.ts` directly for the unit tests and rejects `.tsx`, and this module is on the import
 * path of the files those tests do load.
