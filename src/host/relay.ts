/**
 * The dispatch relay: the one path every dispatch of this host half walks,
 * whatever pressed it — the panel's button or the relay itself.
 *
 * One dispatch, in order: the engine's `conductor.dispatch` lands the cell's
 * material (the launch prompt when it is not already on disk), hands the cell
 * to the executor seam, and — only after a session is really out — writes the
 * `started` claim that keeps the plan from counting the cell as dispatchable
 * again. The executor seam is the native opener (`executor.ts`) hung on the
 * engine: the session, its first instruction and its note are all the opener's
 * own work, and the claim lands as part of the same dispatch, not beside it.
 *
 * Three guarantees live here, and nowhere else:
 *
 * - **One path.** The button used to open a session directly, leaving no
 *   claim behind — a cell it opened was invisible to the plan. Both callers
 *   now walk `dispatchCell`, so a dispatch made by hand and one made by the
 *   relay leave the same marks on disk.
 * - **Serial.** One dispatch at a time, process-wide, whatever triggered it:
 *   every call joins the same chain. The engine's own claim check is still
 *   the guard against a second session (two calls for one cell resolve to
 *   `already_open`), and the chain keeps the calls from even interleaving.
 * - **The trigger.** The relay listens to `turn/end` of the sessions **this
 *   host opened** (tracked here when a dispatch returns), reads the plan
 *   read-only after each turn, and dispatches only when the plan says
 *   `dispatch` — a plan that says `wait` is never overridden, so a dead cell
 *   cannot be driven through. The switch (`autoRelay`, default on) turns the
 *   trigger off; the button keeps working whatever the switch says.
 *
 * The relay never throws into the event bus: a refused trigger logs one line
 * and the panel's button reports its own refusal to the reader.
