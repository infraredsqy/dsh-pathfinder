/**
 * Why a pathfinder operation was refused, as a code rather than a sentence.
 *
 * The host half cannot know which language the reader is looking at: the panel's language is a
 * browser-side fact, decided in the browser and stored in the Host's settings document, and a host
 * method is called per request without one. So a refusal crosses the boundary as a code, and the
 * panel spells the sentence (`src/client/words.ts`).
 *
 * `detail` carries what no dictionary on this side owns: the offending argument, a resolved path,
 * or another program's own output. A refusal whose words come from a program we do not own says so
 * by carrying them here rather than inventing a translation for them.
