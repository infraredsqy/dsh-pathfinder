/**
 * The skills a pf plugin ships, placed where DSH reads skills, and taken back out again.
 *
 * A plugin folder carries its own skills (`<plugin>/skills/<lang>/<method>/SKILL.md`, the convention
 * the plugin contract states). The engine already reads those folders — the scan of the plugin
 * directory, the folders one plugin ships, and the two ways they disagree with the declaration — so
 * nothing here re-reads a plugin's declaration or guesses at its skills: the engine hands over the
 * facts, this file owns what happens next.
 *
 * Four decisions this module makes, all of them stated where they are made:
 *
 * - **The skills go into the root a provider scans, not into a runtime registration.** In this
 *   composition the enabled `skill-filesystem` providers are mounted by the agent preset's standing
 *   composition, so their entries live in the preset layer; a runtime registration made by this line
 *   lands in the global layer, and the nearer layer wins a duplicate name outright — rank is only
 *   consulted inside one layer. Writing the files into `<dshHome>/skills` puts both copies in the
 *   same provider's scan, where the provider's own ranks decide: that root is 400, the old
 *   hand-copied copies under `<agentsHome>/skills` are 500. The root is resolved the way the provider
 *   resolves a config-less `dshHome` — `DSH_HOME`, else `~/.dsh`.
 * - **One language per method.** The same method ships under `zh` and `en`; a skill root keys a skill
 *   by the name in its frontmatter, so two copies would leave whichever the scan reached first. Each
 *   method is placed once, in the host's language when this half can know it (`zh` when it cannot —
 *   see {@link DEFAULT_LANGUAGE}).
 * - **The manifest is the only thing unloading touches.** Every file this line writes is recorded
 *   (`<dshHome>/pathfinder/skills.json`, outside the skill root so the provider never scans it), and
 *   unloading removes exactly those files: not a directory holding somebody else's file, not the old
 *   hand-copied copies, not another root's skills. A second install replaces what the previous
 *   manifest recorded, so an upgrade leaves no earlier version behind.
 * - **What is placed is recorded; a session's view is read separately, as a diagnostic.**
 *   Placing happens when the line loads, before any session exists, so this half can honestly hand
 *   back only *placed* (the root and the manifest), never "the catalog shows it". The session view —
 *   `list({ cwd, scope })`, the read a session's catalog does — is read once where a workspace is
 *   known ({@link confirmSkillsInView}) and left as one logger line: a diagnostic, never an install
 *   verdict and never a failed session. It does not decide the completion judgement — that reading is
 *   the session's own catalog, taken over the old hand-copied copies under `<agentsHome>/skills`
 *   (rank 500, below this root's 400). A same-name copy in a project root (rank 100/200) is DSH's own
 *   per-workspace override and lies outside this node's judgement: the diagnostic notes it, and stops
 *   there.
