 * happened by that moment, `scope` says whose head it sits on and which group
 * it belongs to — all three must hold. The state has only two words, `live`
 * and `withdrawn`, judged by a single comparison against `live`; legacy
 * values left over in existing records that the tool no longer claims are not
 * folded and all
 * read as archived, and reading one must never throw. What cannot be measured
 * always counts: a binding to a cycle or node no longer present, or an
 * unrecognized scope spelling, all read as in force.
