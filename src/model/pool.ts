/**

 * On the books or not depends on whether its discovery moment has arrived;
 * which state it sits in takes the record's own word, and that word belongs
 * to the moment it was written — before the last-modified moment it reads as
 * not yet closed (`open`); weight multiplies by its tier in the weight table,
 * and the issues judged `external` stay on the books and still count as
 * standing, just left out of the weighted sum.
 *
 * Neither the weight table nor the policy line sits on a ready-made field in
 * the records: the former is written in some maintenance node's own
 * description (`P3/P2/P1/P0 = 1/2/4/8`), the latter is a cycle's own
 * `issue_pool_weight_limit`.
